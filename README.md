# Pig Game

The Pig Game is a simple, yet entertaining dice game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed for two players who take turns rolling a single dice. The objective is to accumulate a score of 100 points or more before the opponent does.

## Game Rules

1. The game starts with Player 1 rolling the dice.
2. On each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they wish.
3. Each roll's value gets added to the player's current score (the "Current" section on the screen).
4. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and their current score is reset to 0.
5. A player can choose to "Hold" their turn, which adds their current score to their total score (the "Score" section on the screen).
6. The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more wins the game.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The game will start with Player 1's turn.
3. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice.
4. Continue rolling until you want to "Hold" your score or roll a 1.
5. Click the "Hold" button to add your current score to your total score and switch turns.
6. The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more wins the game.
7. Click the "New Game" button to reset and start a new game.
